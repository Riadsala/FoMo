Model Variants [1.0 and 1.1]

The original version of the model scaled $x$ and  $y$ to (0, 1). This was done to account for the fact that the different datasets we have applied our model to have used very different experimental setups and as display distance is not always controlled, it is hard to convert to visual angle. However, in our original implementation, we mistakenly applied this transform before calculating the inter-item distances in our pre-processing.  As most foraging datasets are based on rectangular stimuli, this has the effect of expanding the vertical distances relative to the horizontal. 

Version 1.0 of the model in this paper therefore implements the original model in Clarke (2022), but with this absolute proximity parameter corrected. We first scale x to (0, 1) and y to (0, a), where a is the aspect ratio (For example, a=0.625 if the screen resolution is 900x1440). This preserves the ratio between a and y, and allows us to correctly calculate the distance (and angles) between each pair of items.  Only after having done this pre-processing do we then scale y to (0, 1).

In version 1.1 of the model, we decided to test whether relative inter-item distance would offer a better fit to the data over using absolute distance. Specifically, for each item selection, we divide all inter-target distances by the distance to the closest item. I.e., the relative distance from the current item to the closest remaining item is now delta=1. Our hope here was that this would improve the model's ability to account for behaviour towards the end of a trial when the remaining items are sparser: however, we did not find any evidence that this improved performance, so we return to absolute proximity for all other model variants.
