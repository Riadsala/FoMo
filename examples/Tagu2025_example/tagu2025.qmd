First, we need to get set up:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(cmdstanr)
library(patchwork)

source("../../functions/import_data.R")
source("../../functions/post_functions.R")
source("../../functions/plot_model.R")

```


# Import

## Loading Data


```{r}
d <- import_data("tagu2025")

summary(d$found)

summary(d$stim)
```


## Loading Model

The model was previously run and saved

```{r}
m <- readRDS("../1_fit_models/scratch/models/tagu2025all1_0.model")

m$summary()
```

Now extract posterior samples and predictions.

```{r}
pred <- extract_pred(m, d)
post <- extract_post(m, d)
```


# Accuracy

```{r}
acc <- summarise_acc(pred)
plot_model_accuracy(acc)
```

Looks like the model does a pretty good job of predicting which item will be selected next in all three conditions.
