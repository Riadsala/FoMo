*Import Data*

Data should be imported using the import_data() function. You will need to write your own code if you have a new dataset in a new format 

The output of this import function should return a list of tibbles: d$stim and d$found

(x, y) coordinates are in Euclidean coordinates, with (0, 0) indicating the *bottom left* corner of the display. 
Coordinates are scaled such that $x \in (0, 1)$ and $y \in (0, a)$ where $a$ is the aspect ratio.
